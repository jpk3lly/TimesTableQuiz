## About this Repo :

A few years ago, when I was first getting into coding, I decided to make a quiz to help my son learn his times tables. As it was my first go at HTML and JavaScript it's fairly 
basic and I'm quite sure that there are plenty of improvements and additional features that can be made to it. 

Then I thought, it's October! it's Hacktoberfest, lets see what we can make as a community.
